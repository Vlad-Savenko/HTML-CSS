            James Naismith c.â€‰1920
            In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical education and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts,[5] was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.
            [6] <span class="text-student">He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students</span> occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall. 
            <span class="text-wrote">Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track</span>. <span class="text-Naismmith">Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact</span>, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored. This quickly proved tedious, 
            so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket.</p>
